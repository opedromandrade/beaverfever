BuntuScripts
===========================
These are some (very) small/basic scripts to run on a freshly installed [minimal] Ubuntu installation, and install of MY preferred software with little to no work/human intervention. This might also work in some Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

Feel free to transform, distribute or adapt this script according to YOUR needs.

Suggestions are very welcome.
